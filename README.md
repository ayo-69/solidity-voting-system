# Solidity Voting System

This project is a simple implementation of a decentralized voting system using Solidity. It demonstrates how blockchain technology can be leveraged to create transparent and tamper-proof voting mechanisms.

## Features

- Allows the contract owner to add candidates
- Enables users to cast a single vote for their preferred candidate
- Ensures that each address can vote only once
- Provides functionality to retrieve the list of candidates and their respective vote counts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
